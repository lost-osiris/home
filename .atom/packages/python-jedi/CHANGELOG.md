## 0.3.7
* Completely removed completion daemon using jediserver & ajax which is replaced by bufferedprocess. One of the reason mainly because a local interviewer 
  denied giving developer job to me saying that i didn't mention about using '$'-symbol in jQuery and the other reason is bufferedprocess works which i may 
  have figured it late. Not too late!
* Removed enable python2, path2python options. Just enter the path to python executable at path2python field.
