Install autocomplete-plus before installing this package.\n\n### Usage\n  - python-jedi uses python3 interpreter in your path by default.(i.e., by default Pathtopython field holds value python3).\n  -\tEnter the path to python executable in the settings(Pathtopython field) (eg:/home/user/py3pyenv/bin/python3 or /home/user/py2virtualenv/bin/python).\n\n#### To Use Goto Definition\n  - Use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl-alt-j`.\n\n### Note\n  - You may get spawn error if python executable is not in your path. To avoid frequent spawn errors -> enter the path to python executable in Path2python field (eg: /usr/bin/python3 or /usr/bin/python2 or /usr/bin/python).\n  - I do not know whether this extension works in windows os environment.
