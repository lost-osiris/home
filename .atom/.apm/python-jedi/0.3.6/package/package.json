Install autocomplete-plus before installing this package.\n\n### Usage\n\npython-jedi uses python3 interpreter in your path by default.\n\nFor python2 autocomplete go to settings -> check Enable Python2 and uncheck to use Python3.\n\n#### To Use virtualenv/pyvenv\n  - Add virtualenv path or pyvenv path in the settings(Pathtopython field).(eg:/home/user/py3pyenv/bin/python3 or /home/user/py2virtualenv/bin/python).\n\n  - Check 'Enable Pathtopython' option in package settings.\n\n  - Make sure you are giving the correct virtualenv/pyvenv path. Otherwise autocomplete won't work. Also for python2 virtualenv path to work, you must have checked 'Enable Python2' option.\n\n#### To Use Goto Definition\n  - Use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl-alt-j`.\n\n### Note\n\n- If you are not using virtualenv path, please uncheck 'Enable Pathtopython'.\n\n- The completion daemon is started on port 7777 - please make sure no\nother service is using this port.\n\n- The completion daemon is stopped appropriately, which was fully tested in linux\nenvironment. The package has not been tested under windows environment. It might\nbe buggy.\n\n### Warning\n\nDo not use it along with autocomplete-plus-jedi. Since it is originally forked\nfrom it, python-jedi may malfunction.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/saravanan-k90/python-jedi/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/saravanan-k90/python-jedi#readme","_id":"python-jedi@0.3.6","_shasum":"976b222c1a32afe18846edaec13d6fa86f774264","_resolved":"file:../d-11619-10477-vyf07r/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11619-10477-vyf07r/package.tgz"}
